I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my adviser, Pr. 
Xiaolin Li. He is the best advisor, who gave me inspiring suggestions
on research and patient guidance towards my PhD degree; He is my family, who 
support me for every decision I made and we enjoy family time together 
during Thanks-giving and Christmas; He is a good friend, with whom I can share
any happiness and sorrow. I feel so proud to be his student and enjoy all the
four-year time spent with him.

I really appreciate the encouragement and valuable technical suggestions from
Pr. Svetlozar Rachev, Pr. Yuefan Deng and Pr. Anthony Phillips. 
You are the most outstanding researchers in your field. I feel so
